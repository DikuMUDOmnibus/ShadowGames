            Each topic will have a reference at the end of the document that will give
            a concise explanation, as well as parameters, locations, or any relevant
            information.





--MUD OPERATION--
-----------------


  The mud is run as a background task and is fault-tolerant through the use of the "startup"
file located in ../godwars/merc/area.
This file is an executable that keeps the mud running through reboots, and crashes, and generates
a "logfile" in the ../godwars/merc/log Directory. The logfile is indexed and begins at #1000, and
includes all "logged" commands passed from the mud, as well as logins, logouts, reboots, bugs, 
and command-faults (command causes an error). Each subsequent cycle of "shutdown-startup" 
generates an index file one number higher than the previous file. 


               -* STARTUP *-

 1) login to the domain shell.
    a) telenet into shadowgames.mudservices.com port 23
    b) enter login and password info.

 2) change to the "area" directory
    a) cd godwars
    b) cd merc
    c) cd area

 3) iniate the "startup" process
    a) type ../area/startup &
    
 The "&" character is very important, it executes the "startup" procedure as a background task.  
 This will execute the startup file, and "boot" the mud at the port assigned in the file, begin
 the logfile, and return you to the main shell prompt.

 4) Logout of the shell
    a) type Logout


		-* REBOOT *-

 1) Login to the mud on the port you wish to reboot as your IMP.

 2) If any players on at the time, inform of reboot, and allow some time for fights to stop, etc.

 3) Simply type REBOOT

 The reboot command does an AutoSave of all players online, and terminates all active connections.
 The Startup file will physically re-activate the mud within a few seconds, and normal connections
 may resume.



		-* SHUTDOWN *-

 1) Login to the mud on the port you wish to Shutdown completely with your IMP.
 
 2) If any players on at the time, inform of shutdown, and allow some time for fights to stop, etc.

 3) Simply type SHUTDOWN

 The Shutdown command will permanently shutdown the mud at that port, and terminate all active
 connections. The startup process will also terminate, and the logfile will be closed. To 
 start the mud after a shutdown process, you will need to go through the procedure in the 
 startup section.



		-* WIZLOCK *-   
 
 1) Login to the mud on the port you wish to lock (with your IMP).

 2) Simply type WIZLOCK

 This will "lock-out" all non-IMP players, to "un-lock" simply type WIZLOCK again.
 This will not "kick-off" players who are already on-line, it will only prevent anyone from
 getting in.



		-* LOGGING A PLAYER *-

 1) Type LOG PLAYERNAME, where playername is the char you wish to log.

 All of the players actions will be logged into the MAIN logifle.

   *** ALSO *** The log command is continuous, that is, it will log that player until you
 remove him from the log-buffer by typing log playername again. It will continue to log the 
 player even if he quits, and comes back...








		-* SKILL SETTING *-

  Skill setting is used to set a players "rating" in a skill (i.e kick, armor spell, heal, etc.)
  The maximum for any skill is, of course 100. 

  1) To SSET a single skill on a player :
	a)  SSET PLAYERNAME SKILLNAME VALUE
 	b) Where skillname is the skill to be set and value is a range of 0-100.



		-* MSET *-

  M(ob)Setting can also be used on players (and is in fact more commonly used on players).
  MSET can set many values, ranging from hit/dam (natural, unmodified that is), a.c, thirst,
  and many of the common "attribute" type settings of a character. It can also be used to
  "string" or set descriptions on mobs / players.

  1) To MSET a player or mob :
	a) MSET PLAYERNAME FIELD VALUE
	b) Where field can be any of :
        	str int wis dex con sex level exp
                gold hp mana move primal align
                thirst drunk full hit dam ac
	c) and value is determined by the field :
	   1) ANY main stat (str, int, etc..) 3-18, this is natural unmodified value.
 	   2) hp/mana/move, any value (there is a limit, but no player will ever be set to it)
	      This value is MAXIMUM, the current value will be the same, so you will have
	      to RESTORE player/mob to bring them up (or down) to the number you set.
	   3) Align : -1000 to 1000
	   4) Gold : not used (or not many people use gold anymore)
	   5) hit/dam (this is NATURAL UNMODIFIED) : 0 to 50		
	   6) primal : 0 to 100
	   7) Level (refers to level of commands and spells available to player), can be one of :
		Mortal, Avatar, Apprentice, Mage, Archmage, Builder, Questmaker, Enforcer,
                Judge, or Highjudge.
           8) thirst, drunk, full : these denote corresponding "living conditions" :
		a) Drunk : If set above 10, character will slur speech, the higher the value
			   the more slurred and un-readable it becomes, and the longer it lasts.
			   Drunk range is 0 to 100.
		b) Thirst / full : range 0 to 100 , with LOWER getting THIRSTIER and HUNGRIER.
	   9) Sex : 0 = IT
		    1 = MAN
   		    2 = WOMAN

		EXAMPLES :	MSET Apocalypse str 18 (sets my str to 18)
				MSET Apocalypse drunk 100 (makes me one drunk bastard)
				MSET Eyedol sex 2 (sets eyedols sex to what it SHOULD be, woman)
				MSET janitor hp 1000 (makes the janitors max hp 1000) with this
				I would have to RESTORE JANITOR to get his current hp to his
				max.


		-* PSET *-

  P(layer)Setting can technically be used on mobs (things like immunities) also.
  Pset sets many values such as immunities, quest points, stances, weapons, etc..

  1) To PSET a player or mob :
	a) PSET PLAYERNAME AREA FIELD VALUE

	b) Where AREA can be one of :
	    quest quest+ quest- weapon immune beast
            blue red yellow green purple 
            mongoose crane crab viper bull mantis
            dragon tiger monkey swallow 

	c) Where FIELD can be one of :
            Weapon:  slice stab slash whip claw blast   
            Weapon:  pound crush grep bite pierce suck 
	    Immune:  slash stab smash animal misc charm
	    Immune:  heat cold acid summon voodoo 
            Immune:  hurl backstab shielded kick disarm
            Immune:  steal sleep drain sunlight

	1) Quest : range 1 to 15000
	   a) quest+ and quest- do not work, and should be removed from the list of PSETs.
	   b) COLOR (blue, red, etc..) refers to the Color groups of spells
		Range 4 to 200.
	   c) STANCE (mongoose, crab, etc..) refers to the corresponding stance.
		range 0 to 200
	   d) WEAPON (slice, bash, etc)..) refers to the corresponding weapon type.
		range 0 to 200
	   e) IMMUNE (slash, kick, cold, etc..) refers to the corresponding immunity.
		range 0 to 1 (0 = OFF, 1 = ON)


	EXAMPLES :	PSET APOCALYPSE QUEST 100  (sets my qp to 100)
			PSET BULLSHIT IMMUNE STEAL 1 (sets BULLSHITS immunity to steal ON)
			PSET BULLSHIT IMMUNE STEAL 0 (sets BULLSHITS immunity to steal OFF)
			PSET BULLSHIT RED 200 (sets bullshit to Grand sorcerer in red magic)



		-* OFIND *-

  OFIND is used to "find" the VNUM of an object, for purposes of OLOADing it, etc..

	1) To OFIND something :

		a) Simply type OFIND OBJECT
		b) where object can literally, be any object in the game.

	*** NOTE *** Some objects cannot be found using OFIND :
		Pen (for writing mage spells) or PAGE will not yield vnums, or book..
	This is due to the fact that these objects SHARE VNUM 30037, this vnum is a "tool"
        vnum, and the actual object is determined at the time of casting MAJOR creation.
	This FIND tool also does NOT list the objects CURRENTLY in the game, it will merely
	tell you what is DEFINED in the game (I.E. does NOT duplicate the LOCATE spell).

		EXAMPLES : 	OFIND Knife 
 
	Mud replies :         [ 2202] A dragon's tooth knife
                              [ 8009] A knife

	***NOTE****	Where the [####] is the VNUM to LOAD this object.




		-* OLOAD *-

  OLOAD (object load) loads any object that is defined in an area file, that is, any object in 
  the current "boot-up" of the game.


	1) To OLOAD something :

		a) Type OLOAD VNUM
		b) Where VNUM is its V(irtual index)Number, found with OFIND command.

  This will load an un-modified, item that will say "Created by" whoever loaded it, and be 
  completely new.
	
			EXAMPLES :	OLOAD 8009 (from the OFIND above)

		Mud replies :		You create a knife.

		*** NOTE *** At Creation time (when you load an object), the object will
		have its min and max damage randomized, within the allowable range of that
		object, so you wont get a knife that does 400 points avg. damage, but each
		time you load one, it will be different from the last.
			



		
		-* OSTAT *-

  OSTAT (Object STAT) provides a very detailed description of an object, be it in your possession
  or not. The object is "statted" with a VERBAL (not numeric) argument, that is, it does NOT
  use the VNUM to STAT, if you try to use the VNUM it will respond by saying nothing like that
  exists.


	1) To OSTAT something :
		
		a) OSTAT SWORD

	***NOTE***  This will provide Stats in a logical order, it will try to "STAT" something
		    called sword in your possession first, if no sword there, it will "STAT"
		    the FIRST sword in the game...

			EXAMPLES :  OSTAT Sword

	***NOTE*** In this first example Im going to assume I have a "Sentris two handed sword"
		   (VNUM 2457) In my inventory, that I created with OLOAD.

 Mud replies :		Name: two-handed sword.
                        Vnum: 2457.  Type: weapon.
			Short description: sentri's two-handed sword.
			Long description: Sentri's two-handed sword is here.
			Object creator: Apocalypse.  Object owner: None.  Quest points: 0.
			Wear bits: 8193.  Extra bits: anti-evil.
			Weight: 20/20.
			Cost: 1584.  Timer: 0.  Level: 12.
			In room: 0.  In object: (none).  Carried by: Apocalypse.  Wear_loc: -1.
			Values: 30 4 5 3.
			Affects damage roll by 8.
			Affects hit roll by 8.


	Most of this information is very straightforward, vnum, creator, long desc., etc..
	The "VALUES" section contains this information :

		BIT 0 (30 for this example) is the weapon POWER this item has
		30 = Dispel Evil (if you cast id on it, it will say something like
		     this weapon is the bane of all evil)
		BIT 1 (4 for this example) is MINIMUM damage
		BIT 2 (5 for this example) is MAXIMUM damage
		BIT 3 (3 for this example) is at this time, unknown by the author, and
		through testing, seems to have no effect on the object.


	Other BITS that have an effect that is not really related to their name :

		LEVEL BIT = Spell POWER of the weapon (i.e. minor spell weapon, greater, etc..)
		


	In this example Im going to assume NO sword is in my inventory.

			EXAMPLE : OSTAT sword


			Name: sword small.
			Vnum: 3021.  Type: weapon.
			Short description: a small sword.
			Long description: A small sword lies here.
			Object creator: None.  Object owner: None.  Quest points: 0.
			Wear bits: 8193.  Extra bits: none.
			Weight: 3/3.
			Cost: 5520.  Timer: 0.  Level: 24.
			In room: 0.  In object: (none).  Carried by: vagabond.  Wear_loc: 16.
			Values: 0 7 8 11.



	This information comes from the FIRST sword the mud "created" at boot time, that is
	which item with this name got initialized first. In this example the sword is a small
	sword, carried by a vagabond.



		




-----------------------------------PFILE EDITING-------------------------------------------------



 Simply follow the directions under each "class" heading to set a player to that particular 
class. This section also contains some information on "supplementary bits" for classes, and 
will be expanded continuously.

All entries in the pfile must be ended with a ~ (tilde).
   ** PLEASE ** keep the spacing that is in the pfile, it makes reading them much easier.


Each necessary setting is followed by an actual line from a pfile as it should look to
set the character properly.

BIT numbering begins with ZERO...That is :
 
 BIT 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.....

 Where the "first" of the above string is called the ZERO bit.
